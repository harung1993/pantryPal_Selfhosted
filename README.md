## The Story Behind PantryPal

My wife and I have a pantry in the basement. We kept buying duplicate items because we couldn't remember what we already had down there, and we'd regularly discover expired food we'd forgotten about.

As a data scientist learning software development as a hobby, I built PantryPal to solve this problem. It integrates with our Home Assistant setup and lets us quickly scan barcodes to track what we have.

Simple problem, over-engineered solution. But it works.

This is the first of three household management tools I'm building as part of the PalStack - a suite of privacy-first, self-hosted life management applications:

- **PantryPal** - You're here! Pantry inventory management
- **PropertyPal** - Property and maintenance tracking (in development)
- **BudgetPal** - Debt repayment and household budgeting (fork of DollarDollar Bill Y'all)

---

## What PantryPal Does

**The Core Problem:** "Do we have tomato sauce, or should I buy it?"

**The Solution:**
- Scan barcodes with your phone to add items instantly
- Get notified before things expire
- Integrate with Home Assistant for automations
- Voice control: "Hey Google, do we have pasta?" (coming soon)
- Multi-user support so the whole family can contribute

---

## Key Features

### For Everyday Use
- **Barcode Scanning**: Quick item entry via mobile camera
- **Manual Entry**: Add items without barcodes
- **Expiry Tracking**: Know what's expiring before it goes bad
- **Multi-User Support**: Family members can all access and update
- **Beautiful Web Dashboard**: Minimal, clean interface with dark mode
- **Mobile App**: Native iOS app with biometric authentication (Face ID/Touch ID)
- **User Authentication**: Secure account-based access with session management

### For Home Assistant Fans
- **REST API Integration**: Pull pantry data into Home Assistant
- **Automation Support**: Trigger notifications, shopping lists, etc.
- **Voice Control Ready**: Foundation laid for Google Assistant/Alexa integration
- **Self-Hosted**: No cloud dependencies, runs on your network
- **API Key Support**: Secure service-to-service authentication

### Privacy & Control
- **100% Self-Hosted**: Your data never leaves your network
- **No Subscriptions**: Free and open for personal use
- **No Tracking**: No analytics, no telemetry, no phone-home

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker Hub (Easiest - Recommended)

Pull pre-built images from Docker Hub - no need to clone the repo!

```bash
# Download docker-compose file
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harung1993/pantrypal/main/docker-compose-hub.yml

# (Optional) Create .env file for email notifications
cat > .env << 'EOF'
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
SMTP_FROM_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_FROM_NAME=PantryPal
SMTP_USE_TLS=true
EOF

# Start PantryPal
docker-compose -f docker-compose-hub.yml up -d

# Access at http://localhost
```

**First Time Setup:**
1. Open http://localhost in your browser
2. Click "Sign Up" to create your account
3. Set your username and password
4. Configure default location and categories in Settings

### Option 2: Build from Source

For developers or if you want to customize:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/harung1993/pantrypal.git
cd pantrypal

# Start services (builds automatically)
./start-pantrypal.sh

# Or manually
docker-compose up -d
```

### Prerequisites (for both options)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- (Optional) Home Assistant instance
- (Optional) SMTP for email notifications
- For iOS app: Request TestFlight access (email: palstack4u@gmail.com)

**That's it!** Open http://localhost in your browser and create your account.

## Architecture

Built with a microservices architecture for easy maintenance and future expansion:

```
nginx (reverse proxy)
├── api-gateway (FastAPI)     # Authentication, routing, email notifications
├── inventory-service         # Item CRUD operations
├── lookup-service            # Barcode to product info lookup
└── web-ui (React)            # Dashboard interface
```

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: Python 3.11 + FastAPI
- Frontend: React 18 + Vite
- Mobile: React Native + Expo
- Database: SQLite (simple, portable, no setup)
- Reverse Proxy: nginx
- Barcode Data: Open Food Facts API

---

## Authentication Modes

PantryPal supports flexible authentication to fit different use cases. Configure `AUTH_MODE` in `docker-compose.yml`:

| Mode | Best For | Home Network | External Access |
|------|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **full** | Maximum security (recommended) | Login required | Login required |
| **smart** | Convenience at home | Open (no login) | Login required |
| **none** | Single user only | Open | Open (insecure) |
| **api_key_only** | API integrations | API key only | API key only |

**Default Mode:** `full` - All users must create accounts and login, ensuring secure access from anywhere.

### Authentication Features
- **Session-based authentication** for web and mobile
- **API key support** for Home Assistant and service integrations
- **Biometric authentication** on mobile (Face ID, Touch ID, Fingerprint)
- **Password reset** via email
- **Multi-user support** with admin capabilities

---

## Mobile App Access

The iOS app is distributed via TestFlight for family and early testers.

**Features:**
- Native iOS experience
- Barcode scanning with camera
- Biometric authentication (Face ID/Touch ID)
- Self-hosted server configuration
- Full inventory management on the go

**Request Access:**
- Email: palstack4u@gmail.com
- Subject: "PantryPal TestFlight Request"
- Include: Your Apple ID email

You'll receive an invitation within 24-48 hours.

**Note:** This is a personal project for family use, not a commercial app. No App Store release is planned.

## Home Assistant Integration

### Quick Setup

Add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: rest
    name: Pantry Expiring Items
    resource: http://YOUR_SERVER_IP/api/stats/expiring?days=7
    headers:
      X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    value_template: "{{ value_json.summary.total_expiring }}"
    json_attributes:
      - summary
      - items
    scan_interval: 3600
```

### Generate API Key

1. Log in to PantryPal web interface
2. Go to Settings
3. Scroll to "API Keys" section
4. Click "Generate New API Key"
5. Give it a name (e.g., "Home Assistant")
6. Copy the key and use it in your Home Assistant configuration

### Example Automation

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Morning Pantry Check"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "09:00:00"
    condition:
      - condition: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.pantry_expiring_items
        above: 0
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Pantry Alert"
          message: "{{ states('sensor.pantry_expiring_items') }} items expiring soon"
```

## The PalStack Vision

PantryPal is part of a larger ecosystem of self-hosted life management tools I'm building:

### PantryPal (This Project)
**Status:** Production Ready
**Purpose:** Never buy duplicate groceries again
**Integrations:** Home Assistant, mobile apps

### PropertyPal (In Development)
**Purpose:** Track home maintenance, warranties, and property documents
**Why:** Because I can never remember when I last changed the HVAC filter

### BudgetPal (Planned)
**Purpose:** Household budgeting with focus on debt repayment
**Based on:** DollarDollar Bill Y'all methodology
**Why:** Making finances manageable and transparent for couples

All three share the same philosophy:
- **Privacy-first**: Self-hosted, no cloud dependencies
- **Family-focused**: Multi-user, easy for everyone to use
- **Smart home ready**: Built with Home Assistant integration in mind
- **Open source**: AGPL-3.0 for personal use

## Why Self-Hosted?

Because your pantry inventory is your personal data. You shouldn't need:
- A subscription to track your own groceries
- Permission from a cloud service to access your data
- Internet connectivity to know what's in your basement

Self-hosting means:
- Complete privacy and control
- No recurring costs
- Works offline
- Integrate with anything
- Modify as needed

---
